## Hybrid ethnography (Przybylski)

- ethnography: describing cultures
  - typically using the method of "participant observation"
  - ethnographer as "observer, analyst, and storyteller" (2)
  - "Understanding a people's culture exposes their normalness without reducing their particularity" (Geertz 1973, 14)
- hybrid ethnography: doing ethnographic research using a combination of online and offline observation

## Hybrid ethnography (Przybylski)

- "Be your own media": data (recordings, posts, etc.) come not just from the observer's notebook
- truly participating in both online & offline settings
- Where are/were people when _not_ online?
- A lot of data to work through

## Hybrid ethnography (Przybylski)

- complex identities (self & other)
- bodily effect of location/place
- synchronous & asynchronous communication
- new publication opportunities & obligations
